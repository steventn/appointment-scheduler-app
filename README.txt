Title: Company Appointment Scheduler App
Purpose: Java application with a GUI that helps company employees schedule appointments with their clients, view reports, and adjust customer information.
Application Version: v1.0
Date: 10-10-2023

IDE Version: IntelliJ IDEA 2023.2.1
JDK Version: Java 17.0.8
Java FX Version: JavaFX-SDK-17.0.2
MySQL Connector Driver Version: mysql-connector-java-8.0.25

How to run the program:
Starting the program from MainApp.java will launch a login screen where correct credentials must be entered. Once the user is successfully logged in, the main screen will display both the Customer and Appointment table with corresponding Add, Modify, and Delete buttons that will open up their respective forms. Each screen has an exit button that will either lead them back to the main view or exit the application. In the main screen, there is also a Report button that will display 3 reports.

Report of choice:
For my report of choice, I decided to display average duration of appointments per customer by month. This is similar to Report B where total appointments are displayed for the type of appointment by month. I thought it would be interesting to see how long appointments usually are to either increase or decrease appointment length for employees scheduling client meetings.
